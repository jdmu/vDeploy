# vDeploy 6.7

This Project is a fork of Russell Hamker's vDeploy initially developed for:
  *1) Powershell v5    
  *2) PowerShell Module VMware.PowerCLI 6.5 
  *3) PowerShell Module PowerNSX 3.0   
  *4) Vsphere 6.5
  *5) VMware NSX 6.3.3
  
I am testing and updating the code to be a little more extensible, add features, bug fix, and make it compatible with vSphere 6.0, 6.5, and 6.7.

## Getting Started

Clone or download the GitHub project, then run vDeploy.ps1 in an elevated powershell prompt.
